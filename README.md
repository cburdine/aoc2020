Cburdine's Advent of Code 2020 Solutions
---

These are my solution to the 2020 Advent of Code challenge.

My solutions are written in Python3 and C++. The solutions written in Python3 can be run "as is" with a Python3 interpreter, as they have no external dependencies. I would recommend using Python 3.8.6 or later. 

The C++ solutions can be compiled with the corresponding GNU Makefiles. (If GNU make is installed, simply run ``make`` in the directory with a Makefile). These Makefiles invoke the GNU g++ compiler.

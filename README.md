Cburdine's Advent of Code 2020 Solutions
---

These are my solution to the 2020 Advent of Code challenge.

My solutions are written in Python3 and C++. The solutions written in python can be run "as is" with a Python3 interpreter (I would recommend Python 3.8.6 or later). 

The C++ solutions can be compuled with the corresponding GNU Makefiles. (If GNU make is installed, simply run ``make`` in the directory with a make file. These Makefiles use the GNU g++ compiler.
